## Day 9 - 04/02/25
Today, I worked on multiple Java programs that reinforced key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as static variables, final variables, `this` keyword, and `instanceof` checks through real-world applications.

### Programs Implemented:
- **Student Management System**: Used static variables, final variables, and `instanceof` checks.
- **Vehicle Registration System**: Implemented static methods, final registration numbers, and `instanceof` checks before displaying vehicle details.
- **Hospital Management System**: Managed patient data using static variables for hospital names, final patient IDs, and `instanceof` checks before displaying patient information.
- Practiced and reinforced concepts like static methods, final variables, `this` keyword, and `instanceof` checks.

## Day 11 - 07/02/25

### Advanced Java OOP & Hybrid Inheritance
Today, I worked on multiple Java programs that reinforced Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Hybrid Inheritance through real-world applications:

- **Animal Hierarchy**
  - Implemented an `Animal` superclass with subclasses: `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`.
  - Overrode `makeSound()` in each subclass to demonstrate method overriding.
  - Used polymorphism to call `makeSound()` dynamically.

- **Employee Management System**
  - Implemented `Employee` as a superclass with subclasses: `Manager`, `Developer`, and `Intern`.
  - Introduced attributes like `teamSize` (for `Manager`) and `programmingLanguage` (for `Developer`).
  - Overrode `displayDetails()` to show unique employee information.

- **Vehicle Management System (Hybrid Inheritance)**
  - Created a `Vehicle` superclass with `maxSpeed` and `fuelType`.
  - Implemented `ElectricVehicle` and `PetrolVehicle` as subclasses.
  - Created an interface `Refuelable`, implemented by `PetrolVehicle`.
  - Demonstrated hybrid inheritance by making `PetrolVehicle` extend `Vehicle` while implementing `Refuelable`.

- **Library Management System**
  - Designed a `Book` superclass and an `Author` subclass.
  - Overrode `displayInfo()` to print book and author details.

- **Smart Home System**
  - Created a `Device` superclass with `deviceId` and `status`.
  - Implemented `Thermostat` as a subclass with `temperatureSetting`.
  - Overrode `displayStatus()` to display unique device information.

- **Restaurant System (Hybrid Inheritance)**
  - Created a `Person` superclass.
  - Defined a `Worker` interface with a `performDuties()` method.
  - Implemented `Chef` and `Waiter` subclasses that inherit from `Person` and implement `Worker`, showcasing multiple inheritance through interfaces.
